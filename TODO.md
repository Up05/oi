# TODO 

+ test with newer odin versions
+ switching and closing tabs is janky (whenever not observed)
+ draw mixed code/docs (for package docs, see: `small_array`)
+ test on my laptop (i hate my life)
+ horizontal scrolling
+ accessibility
    + does odin have screen reader anything???
    + using terms when describing types (not, like: "colon color struct curly bracket x color package period type <pause> ..."
        should be "struct 'that has' x 'of type' package dot type" is that possible? who knows...
    + keybinds to navigate over boxes.content
        and activate screen reader (cause fuck man... it must be annoying as hell when it is just always saying shit)
+ maybe nice installation? like File Pilot...
+ (let someone else?) test on windows
+ is there a problem with querying a set of packages?..
+ implement a popup warning system, maybe?..

+ fix various code formatting issues (1st big idea)


# The Big Ideas

1.  Custom doc format, that would support package aliassing in a way, I can understand,
    Would not repeat packages per file. Would not give null things on only base packages.
    Would and would not ...

2.  MAYBE Remark system (users can submit comments on procedures/types/whatever)
    But that's annoying to do from the technical side, because security
    Plus, I'd need to set up, maintain and protect/moderate a server...

3.  MAYBE (If I'm allowed to) scrape the original docs of some bindings, e.g.: SDL
